# randomplayer

The *randomplayer* plays random music from the web.

## Requirements:
* CMake
* Qt5
* git (for pulling dependencies during build)

## Usage:
1. Build as usual: ``cd .. && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../randomplayer.git/ && make``
2. Run ``./randomplayer``
3. Exit with ``Ctrl+C``
4. Put your *Google Api Key* and your *Google Custom Search ID* into the newly created file ``google.ini``.
5. Run again and enjoy various music!

## Note:
* ``randomplayer`` plays what every mp3s it can find, so beware.
* This is a very early stage of development, so please excuse the weird usage instructions and the low-quality code.
